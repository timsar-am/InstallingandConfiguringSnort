Installing and Configuring Snort 

## Objective

Today I am going to install Snort on my Ubuntu machine. 

### Tools Used

- Snort

## Steps

The first thing I am going to do is update my system by running the following command.

After a few minutes the update is complete. Now I need to install Snort. I run the following command.

Once installation is complete. I am met with the following. I hit okay.

Now I need to put in the IP address of my network adapter here.

I open up a new terminal and run the command ip addr highlighted is what I am looking for.

I only need the first part of the IP address to cover the range of 256 addresses and its a /24 network. I enter 192.168.1.0/24

The install is complete. Since my NIC (Network Interface Card) is configured to only receive the packets meant for them as the destination, I wonâ€™t be seeing the other packets coming in. That means I now need to put my NIC  into promiscuous mode. 

I run the following command. From the previous step I know my  NIC is enp0s3

It asks for my password. Once that is complete I open a new window to see if it worked. I run the command ip addr. I can see that PROMISC is on.

Now that this is complete. I will go into the configuration file and make some changes. Some people use vim, I am just going to keep it simple and use nano.

I scroll down to HOME_NET and put in the same IP address as I had. CTRL X, Y to Save and save the config file.

Now that I have successfully installed and configured Snort. I am going to set some rules. There are 4 categories of Snort rules: Community Rules, Registered Rules, Subscription Rules, and Build Your Own Rules.

I will be editing the local rules file using nano- sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

I will be setting a very simple rule to prompt alert if a ping is received on my home network. I will be opening my Kali Linux machine later to test if the rule is working.

Rule breakdown from left to right:  

- alert is the type of action that will be taken. I just want to be alerted.
- icmp is the protocol
- any any is from any source IP and port
- - (>) is the direction of the traffic.
- $HOME_NET will be my home network.
- any would be the destination port.
-  msg would be the message the alert would generate in the logs.
- sid is the Snort ID and rev is revision #

Now that I have added a custom rule. I save the rule file. 

I will now run Snort in quiet mode with the below command.

If nothing happens it means its working. I open up my Kali Linux machine to test this out.

It works. I can see here alerts being generated.

Now I will check the log file with the following command.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3b58dba-742e-4f57-9ad9-911ded9d2352)

Looks like I got 48 packets. None were dropped as I only set up a rule to trigger alerts.

Here we can see the actual alerts, the source and destination IP.

Perfect. Snort is a great IDS/IPS with plenty of community support. There are a ton of documentations and YouTube videos that will assist with confuguration and rule building.
